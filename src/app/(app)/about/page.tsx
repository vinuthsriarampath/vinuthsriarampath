                <p>I began my academic journey to prepare myself for a career in software development in February 2024, right after completing my A/Ls at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, by enrolling at the Institute of Computer Engineering Technology (iCET).</p>
                <p>At iCET, we were guided by industry professionals, and I successfully completed the course with a GPA of 4.25, earning a place on the Directorâ€™s List by the end of the year. I also had the opportunity to participate in the Industry Training Program, where I worked with a company as a Trainee Software Developer.</p>
                <p>During the training program, I was selected by Syigen (Pvt) Ltd along with 15 of my classmates. At Syigen, we had the chance to contribute to several projects, including AI-based applications, and the company also organized several educational sessions focused on AI development.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I also began my Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) and started applying to companies to begin my career as an Associate Software Developer.</p>
